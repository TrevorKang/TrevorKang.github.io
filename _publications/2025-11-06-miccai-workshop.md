Managing scan protocols in Computed Tomography (CT), which includes adjusting acquisition parameters or configuring reconstructions, as well as selecting postprocessing tools in a patient-specific manner, is time-consuming and requires clinical as well as technical expertise. At the same time, we observe an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. To address this issue, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent framework is proposed to assist with the interpretation and execution of protocol configuration requests given in natural language or a structured, device-independent format, aiming to improve the workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload. The agent combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured tool-calling abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate modifications. In a systematic evaluation, experimental results indicate that the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device-compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests. 
Despite demonstrating feasibility in principle, the approach faces limitations regarding syntactic and semantic validity due to lack of a unified device API, and challenges with ambiguous or complex requests. 
In summary, the findings show a clear path towards LLM-based agents for supporting scan protocol management in CT imaging.
