Since 2025, I am beginning my doctoral research under the supervision of Prof. Dr.-Ing. Katharina Breininger@CAIDAS, Uni Würzburg. Before that, I did my M.Sc. at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), with the major of Medical Engineering. 

Currently, my major research topic is the multimodal machine learning for endometriosis, including the integration and analysis of multimodal data sources for endometriosis (WSI/MRI/Ultrasound, etc.) with a particular emphasis on supervised & unsupervised approaches. 

Driven by a deep passion for Deep Learning and medical imaging, I aim to bring together state-of-the-art AI techniques and practical healthcare applications to improve diagnostic accuracy, patient outcomes, and the timeliness of care.
