Hi, I'm Xingjian😁Since November 2025, I am beginning my doctoral research under the supervision of [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Katharina Breininger](https://www.caidas.uni-wuerzburg.de/pr/team/katharina-breininger/), [CAIDAS](https://www.caidas.uni-wuerzburg.de/), Uni Würzburg. Before that, I did my M.Sc. at [Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)](https://www.fau.de/), with the major of [Medical Engineering](https://meinstudium.fau.de/studiengang/medizintechnik-msc/). 

Currently, my main research topic is the multimodal machine learning for endometriosis, including the integration and analysis of multimodal data sources for endometriosis (WSI/MRI/Ultrasound, etc.) with a particular emphasis on supervised & unsupervised approaches. Beyond that, I have gained experience about the developement around LLM/MLLM as well as LLM-Agent, especially the exploration of their roles in the future healthcare industry 👨‍💻  

Driven by a deep passion for Deep Learning and medical imaging, I aim to bring together state-of-the-art AI techniques and practical healthcare applications to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. In AGI we trust😇
